# Collaborative_Filtering

dataset: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

u.data and u.item is used to store the information. My Python cannot handle many data at one time.

Implement a movie rating prediction program for both item-based and user-based collaborative filtering.

Further, we can use the predicted rating to make a movie recommendation sysytem.
